Dogs vs. Cats Image Classification using Support Vector Machines (SVM)
---
## Overview

Welcome to **Prodigy-ML-03**, a project dedicated to implementing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for distinguishing between images of cats and dogs. The model is trained on the Dogs vs. Cats dataset sourced from Kaggle, utilizing scikit-learn for SVM implementation and OpenCV for image preprocessing.

## Dataset

The Dogs vs. Cats dataset consists of thousands of labeled images of cats and dogs. It is a benchmark dataset for image classification tasks and can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data).

## Implementation

### Files

- **ML-Task03.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the SVM classifier implementation.
- **ML-Task03.py**: Python script version of the SVM classifier.
- **requirements.txt**: List of dependencies required to run the code.

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. **Jupyter Notebook (ML-Task03.ipynb):**
   
   Open and run the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook ML-Task03.ipynb
   ```

   Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute and evaluate the SVM classifier.

2. **Python Script (ML-Task03.py):**
   
   Run the Python script directly:

   ```bash
   python ML-Task03.py
   ```

   Ensure you have set up your Python environment and dependencies as per `requirements.txt`.

### Model Evaluation

The SVM classifier is trained using images preprocessed to grayscale and resized for uniformity. Evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, providing insights into the model's performance.
